**Catch Rate**
|Location|Catch Chance (+%)|
|---|---|
|Fished Pokémon (Water encounters in Routes)|15
|All other encounter types|0 (Equal to Poké Ball)

Note that Lure Ball will only have the increased catch chance if the route has a mixture of encounter types. If the route **only** has Water encounters, it will have 0 catch chance.
